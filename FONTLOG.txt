FONTLOG
East Syriac Marcus font family
========================

This file provides detailed information on the East Syriac Marcus font software.
This information should be distributed along with the East Syriac Marcus font and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

This goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font 
that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
East Syriac-based writing system. In addition, there is minimal provision for other 
Latin characters and symbols. 

One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

     * AA-East Syriac Marcus Regular
